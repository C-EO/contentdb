# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We only support the latest production version, deployed to <https://content.minetest.net>.
This is usually the latest `master` commit.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We ask that you report vulnerabilities privately, by contacting rubenwardy,
to give us time to fix them. You can do that by using one of the methods outlined in the following link:
