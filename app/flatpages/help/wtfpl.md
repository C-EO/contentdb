title: WTFPL is a terrible license
toc: False

The use of WTFPL as a license is discouraged for multiple reasons.

* **No Warranty disclaimer:** This could open you up to being sued.<sup>[1]</sup>
* **Swearing:** This prevents settings like schools from using your content.
* **Not OSI Approved:** Same as public domain?

The Open Source Initiative chose not to approve the license as an open-source
license, saying:<sup>[3]</sup>

> It's no different from dedication to the public domain.
> Author has submitted license approval request â€“ author is free to make public domain dedication.
> Although he agrees with the recommendation, Mr. Michlmayr notes that public domain doesn't exist in Europe. Recommend: Reject.
